/***************************************************
 * This is a SPI library for the ATMega328PB.
 *
 * It can provide basic SPI master functionality for any application, but is
 * directly targeted at the Adafruit 1.8" SPI display and its SD card socket.
 * 
 * It is based on example codes from the Atmel device datasheet. The code is
 * kept simple, but is not always efficient. It is an easy-to-understand example
 * for studies and not intended for productive use.
 *
 * This code is in the public domain. Feel free to do with it whatever you want.
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * FOR STUDENTS:
 * 
 * This file is complete, but the according .c file will be given to you in an
 * 'empty' state. See there for further information.
